# ⚙️ Functional Dimensioning & Tolerancing  
### Practical Engineering Exercises Portfolio

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository collects a series of **practical engineering exercises** focused on  
**functional dimensioning and tolerancing of machine elements**.

The objective is to showcase my ability to:
- interpret **functional requirements**,
- apply **functional dimensioning principles**,
- define and analyze **tolerance chains**,
- organize CAD data and documentation following an **industry-oriented workflow**.

The exercises are based on the book  
*“Quotatura funzionale degli organi di macchine”*  
and are solved independently as part of my **professional development**.

## 🧩 Repository Organization

Each exercise is structured as a **self-contained mechanical design project**, reflecting how work is typically organized in an industrial environment.

```

This structure emphasizes **clarity, traceability, and separation of responsibilities** between modeling, drawings, calculations, and documentation.

## 🛠️ Engineering Methodology

Each exercise follows a consistent and repeatable workflow:

1. 🔍 **Functional analysis** of the mechanism  
2. 📐 **Identification of functional datums**  
3. 🎯 **Definition of critical dimensions**  
4. 🔗 **Construction of tolerance chains**  
5. ✅ **Tolerance allocation driven by functional intent**

Design choices and assumptions are explicitly stated whenever required.

## 📂 CAD & File Management Philosophy

Special attention is given to:
- consistent **file naming conventions**,
- separation between **native CAD files** and **neutral formats**,
- clear linkage between **parts, assemblies, and drawings**.

This mirrors best practices commonly adopted in **manufacturing, quality, and airworthiness-oriented environments**.
